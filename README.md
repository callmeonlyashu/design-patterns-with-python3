# Design Patterns with Python 3
This repo contains example for all the design patterns mentioned in the book "Head First Design Patterns"

## Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. 

Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsiblities to an object dynamically. 

Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Factory Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclass decide which class to instantiate. 

Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an inteface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

## Observer Pattern

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

## Command Pattern

The Command Pattern encapsulates the request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize
other objects with different purposes, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations
