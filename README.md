# Software Design Patterns with Python 3
This repo contains example for all the design patterns mentioned in the book "Head First Design Patterns"


## Repo Setup
- Clone the repo.
- Open it in Pycharm (Recommended) or any other IDE.
- If opened in Pycharm the run configurations in .run folder will be there and you can run your pattern to see how is it working. 
- If opened in other IDE, run index.py in the particular pattern you want to see.


## Patterns Defined

### Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. 

Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsiblities to an object dynamically. 

Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Factory Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclass decide which class to instantiate. 

Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

### Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an inteface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

### Observer Pattern

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

### Command Pattern

The Command Pattern encapsulates the request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize
other objects with different purposes, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations

### Facade Pattern

The Facade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces
in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes a subsystem
easier to use.

### Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern converts the interface of the class into the 
another interface which client expects. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise 
because of incompatible interfaces.
